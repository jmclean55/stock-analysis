# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
#### The purpose of this Excel VBA project was to use the art of refactoring to gather stocks and ultimately decide if those stocks were worth investing in.  The stocks were gathered from 2017 and 2018 for Steve's parents to help detemine buying.  The ultimate goal was to increase the efficiency of the code.  We gathered important facets of the data such as the date issued, its ticker value, the opening and closing prices, amongst others.  The final goal was to create a code to determine the ticker, the ticker volumes and the ticker starting/ending prices. 

### Results 
#### ![VBA screenshotJM.png](https://github.com/jmclean55/stock-analysis/blob/main/Resources/VBA%20screenshotJM.png?raw=true) 
The image above shows that I included two loops in the VBA code.

When I executed the code for the 2017 stock ticker, it ran in .164 seconds.

When I executed the code for the 2018 stock ticker, it ran in .164 seconds as well.  

### Summary
####  The advantages of refactoring code is that it allows you to debug code to make it easier to understand, it also makes the code more maintainable.  Advantages of cleaner, easier to understand code can allow faster programming along with overall software improvement.  Most importantly, refactoring can lead to a better quality code.  According to Kent Beck and author Martin Fowler, the most important advantage is that refactoring improves the "Design of Software".
  The disadvantages of refactoring code are that the developers must understand what exactly the code is in order to achieve improving it and making it easier to read.  Another disadvantage may arise if the application is too big, which could lead to producing bugs and errors. Retesting the functionality can also bring up problems with larger applications.  
  
  The biggest advantage to original and refactored VBA scripts is that it increases the overall execution speed while also having a decrease in the macro run time, as seen in pictures above. When revisiting refactored code, it will be an easier to understand code. With the easier to understand refactored code, it then makes it easier to put in more functionality in the application and it will lead to more testable code over time.  
    Disadvantages to refactored code could be a developer writing poorly written code, for example if someone like myself wrote code; as its still a foreign language to me, then a more experienced programmer may have to take a longer time refactoring mine!  In general, refactoring can just take too much time for a programmer.  If the code is done wrong, it can make the application and coding more complex and could even lead to breaking it.
